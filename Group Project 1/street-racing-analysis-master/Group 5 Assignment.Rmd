## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

```

## Load Data

```{r}
street_racing <- read_csv("input/street-racing-fatalities.csv")
```

## Other Files

```{r}
fatalities_racing <- read_csv("output/fatalities.csv")
```

```{r}

fatalities_truncated <- fatalities_racing%>%
  select(name, city, death_datetime, death_year)

fatalities_truncated

```






```{r}
commerce_deaths <- fatalities_racing%>%
filter(name == "Commerce", death_year >= "2000" )

commerce_deaths
```
```{r}

#Code for second finding
deaths_by_year <- street_racing%>%
  summarise(total_year_death = sum(DeathDateTime))
  filter("2007")

#Display below
deaths_by_year
  
```

```{r}
  findings_two <- deaths_by_year%>%
  group_by(death_year)
```
